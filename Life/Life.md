# Life

Life exists in many forms, and this folder helps to document them. If the life is worth mentioning, it should be stored here.

# Folder Organization

The following folder organization is recommended. **These will likely not be enough folders for your purposes- feel free to expand and add more.**

## Fauna

Meant to contain creatures, beasts, and other animal-like life in your world.

## Flora

Meant to contain plants, fungi, and other applicable plant-like life in your world.

## Humanoids

Sometimes referred to as "races", "species", or "lineages" in traditional fantasy, this refers to creatures like orcs, humans, elves, or other fantasy *humanoid* creatures. 

## Magical

Sort of a catch-all term, this is meant to contain clearly magical beings that exist within your world.
