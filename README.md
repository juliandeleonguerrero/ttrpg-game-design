# About

This is a worldbuilding template vault (Obsidian's term for a notebook) for use with the **Obsidian.md** notetaking software. The vault is already setup with basic organization, worldbuilding templates, and plugins that you may find useful for your needs.

# Installing

## Via Releases (recommended for most users)

You can "install" this worldbuilding template by navigating to the "Releases" page of the repo, and downloading the latest release (which should be available in the form of a .zip file). 

Extract that .zip file somewhere safe, rename the folder to the same name as your world, and then open it using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). 

You will receive a warning regarding the plugins installed, and whether you should trust the author upon opening the vault. For obvious reasons, you should always be weary of random content available online... but you can totally trust this vault. ;)

## Via Git

For the technically-minded, this repo can be cloned via Git, and has been marked as a template repository within GitHub.

# Getting Started

*For use after installing the vault on your device.*

It is strongly recommended you read through  [[01- Getting Started]] before beginning to create. Otherwise, have fun worldbuilding!

# Updates and Improvements

Users are welcome to suggest updates and improvements to this template. Feel free to request changes via the Issues tab for this repo.

Pull requests are also accepted, as long as they include a clear explanation of the change being made. Please be advised that PRs that include edits to the `.obsidian` folder will not be accepted by default.
