# Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure that the you've opened the worldbuilding template correctly within Obsidian. It should look something like the following within the file navigation tab to your left:

![[file-explorer-obsidian-getting-started.png|200]]

If all of this is a folder deep, and/or you lack bundled plugins/themes, you may need to open the Obsidian vault with Obsidian.md at a different folder level. 

# Renaming

After opening the worldbuilding vault, you'll probably want to rename it for your own world. Renaming the root folder for the Obsidian vault in your system's file explorer will successfully rename your project in Obsidian.

# Creating your first note

Obsidian supports templates to make your life easier! The templates included with this worldbuilding template account for most of what you'll need for typical fantasy worldbuilding. Just create a note, and then press **Ctrl+Shift+i**. This is the hotkey to insert a template, and you can type out the template you need from there.

Find yourself needing another template not already provided? Go ahead and create one under the Templates folder, as shown here:

As always, if you aren't happy with a template feel free to edit it. It's your world, with your own needs!

# Opening Folder Notes

This template comes with the Folder Notes plugin, which effectively turns folders into notes as well, allowing you to nest notes under other notes. While this is explained in greater detail in the plugin documentation, folder notes are useful for documenting what the folder is meant to contain, and for showing a table of contents using another plugin.

Without getting into too much detail here, the default settings of this template allow you to open the folder note by clicking directly on the name, and open and close the folder itself by clicking anywhere else within its selection area.

# How Obsidian Works

Rather than explaining here, I recommend reading Obsidian's documentation [here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles). I specifically recommend skimming through the "Getting Started" and "How To" sections.

# Further Reading

If you are:
- Unfamiliar with self-organization within Obsidian
- Would like recommendations in general for worldbuilding
- Or need an explanation of how the plugins in this vault work and help with your worldbuilding, I recommend reading through the rest of the documentation within the [[Documentation]] folder.
