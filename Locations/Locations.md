# Locations

The locations folder is meant for outlining various locations within a fantasy world. 

## Folder Organization

There are two approaches to organizing this kind of folder.
1. Organizing by entity type. Bodies of water get their own folder, as do settlements, mountains, etc. If you take this approach, it is highly recommended to tag locations appropriately when connected.
2. More commonly, by hiearchy. As in, locations within a city will usually fall under a city.

## Creating a new location

There are six location templates, listed below. There is no harm in picking the wrong template initially- it is easy to edit an article afterwards to match another template, or alter it for your own purposes.

### Cosmology

Cosmological locations are space stuff- planets, stars, asteroids, and the universe itself.

###  Establishment

Establishments are organized locations dedicated to providing some service or good. This definition is stretched broudly. Stores, churches, libraries, etc would fit. Industrial locations such as mines or farms could fit here as well, assuming they are not significant for being ecosystems- at which point, they are probably appropriate as a natural location.

### Landmark

Landmarks are prominent locations in the world. This can include a dungeon, a major church headquarters, or a ruin. The point of the landmarks template is to help describe major locations not covered by the other use cases.

### Natural

Natural locations are places such as forests, mountains, or rivers.

### Region

Regions include continents, islands, and other locations that tend to contain other locations not well defined by the other location types.

### Settlements

Settlements include towns, villages, cities, and other localized groups of permanently-settled people.
