# Society

Lore about society as we know it can be found here. This is meant to contain cultural concepts created groups of people, and help organize it appropriately.

# Folder Organization

The folder is organized into the following concepts, listed below.

## Art

Art includes music, sculpture, paintings, and any other way that intelligent life uses to express itself in meaningful, transcendental ways.

## Customs

Customs can include customs and traditions, common cultural practices, and other learned activities within the society.

## Economics

Economic systems, matters of currency, and other related information can be stored here.

## Education

This includes teachings, fields of knowledge, and other fields of study notable within the world.

## Language

Both verbal and non-verbal language can be noted here.

## Lore

In-world stories, folklore, and other commonly shared information within the world should be documented here.

## Occupations

Careers, jobs, and ways of living life that allow continuance of life should be documented here.

## Religion

Religions themselves should be noted here- though there may be heavy overlap between religious groups, and the gods themselves. Heavy embedding of other article sections may be useful within articles here.

# Alternative Folder Organization

Another way of organizing these folders would be to create subfolders below the base Society folder, with each subfolder pertaining to a specific society. From there, duplicate the default folders within the Society folder, apart from language, religion, and occupations. 

This is helpful if you want a society-specific breakdown of cultural artifacts, while still maintaining some globally-applicable folders.
