# Hazards

Hazards in TTRPGs are complications in the environment that are not due to NPCs or other actively aggressive traditional statblocks. This includes content like traps, hostile weather, and ongoing environmental effects due to lair effects.

Hazards in TTRPGs usually do not exist as the main enemies in an ongoing encounter, although they can if they are sufficiently complex or interesting enough. Instead, hazards are usually used to enrich encounters, or enhance an overall level/dungeon.
