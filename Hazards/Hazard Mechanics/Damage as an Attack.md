# About Damage as an Attack

When a hazard deals damage to a player as an attack roll, within common popular systems. Though these hazards (usually traps) are not actual enemies that would attack the players, they are meant to target a person's AC, and give them a potential out even if they have activated the hazard.

# Examples

- A needle trap shooting out toward the player.
- Arrows shooting out of a wall
- An automated laser beam.
