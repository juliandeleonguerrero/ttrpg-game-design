# About Damage as a save

Where a hazard forces players to use a system's "save check" to try to avoid damage, or take less damage when they trigger the effects of a hazard. These saves are usually to give players a potential out if they trigger the hazard, and can help ameliorate player discontent in doing so.

# Examples

- Inhaling from a gas trap
- Dodging out of the way from a rolling boulder.
- Grabbing onto a ledge to avoid falling down a pit.
