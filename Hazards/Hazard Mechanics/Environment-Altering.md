# About Environment-Altering

Often a subset of the other base mechanics. Where a hazard is actively altering the environment in a continuous fashion. This is more than just the hazard moving around- it is where the hazard is actively shaping the environment that changes the physical layout of the environment.

# Examples

- An elemental foci changing the terrain to open up holes or shift the ground into new hills and walls.
- Flood water expanding the dissolving banks of a river in rapid fashion.
- A fire steadily burning down parts of a wooden platform.
