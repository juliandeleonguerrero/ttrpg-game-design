# About Mechanical Activation

Hazards are often interactable in physical, direct manners. This involves a player directly and physically interacting with a hazard to move/displace it, neutralize it, or even to activate it.

# Examples

- A portcullis being activated by pulling a lever
- Pressing a button to active a doorway.
- Pushing a boulder that blocks the way.
