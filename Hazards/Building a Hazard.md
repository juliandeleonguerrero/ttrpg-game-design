# Building a Hazard

When building a hazard, you should ask the following questions:

## What is the hazard?

The literal view of the hazard, as the players will experience it. A pit full of fire, pool of acid, or poisonous puddle are all just literal damage holes, but each will have different theming and player views on them. This is, ironically, the most important part of the hazard, despite it actually mattering the least in game mechanic terms. The experience comes first, and the mechanics second.

## What does it do?

The literal mechanics of the hazard. Does it deal damage? What are the conditions of it dealing damage- an attack roll against AC? A saving throw? Automatic damage? Does it cause a condition in a character?

## How does it help the game?

Hazards in TTRPGs are historically poorly thought out, or intentionally unfair to players. Hazards nowadays should increase game complexity in interesting ways that engage the players in interesting ways, ways that ideally force them to think outside the box or feel challenged in a good way.
