# Characters

Characters within the story can be placed here. Useful character notes usually include
- What the character does/how they exist within the world.
- Their motivations
- And some reason for existing within the story.

# Folder Organization

World builders are encouraged to create their own folders and organize appropriately. Some 
common examples are depicted below:

## By Significance

- Characters
	- Major Characters
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)
	- Minor Characters
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)
	- Supporting Characters
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)
	- Main Characters
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)
	- Antagonists
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)

This organization structure:

- Encourages a firm categorical encouragement of a central narrative structure.
- Helps world building authors organize their characters in a way that they understand, behind the scenes.

However...

- It suffers from a lack of realism for history *as we know it*, encouraging a "great person" outlook through the organization method.
- And it can result in difficult to parse organization when there are enough characters- it is much better for self-contained stories, rather than larger overarching worlds.

## By Story Arc

- Characters
	- (Arc Title)
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)
	- (Another Arc Title)
		- (Appropriate Subcategories)

This organization structure:
- Maintains a strong categorical encouragement of a central narrative structure...
- While making it easier to find non-major characters by their relevant story arc.
However...
- It usually requires being paired with other organization structures, as there will be characters within most stories/worlds that transcend specific story arcs.
- It maintains the lack of realism encouraged by significance categorization.

## By Region

- Characters
	- Large region such as a continent, or kingdom.
		- Perhaps a ruler or significant governing character within this region.
		- Sub-region, such as a kingdom or fiefdom.
			- More sub-regions and people who fit within those subregions.

This organization structure:
- Places strong emphasis on the space where the characters live within.
- Is very useful for finding characters.
- And can even mean combining the location and character folders, if the world builder in question finds this to their tastes.
However...
- This organization structure does not account for nomadic or transient people very well- it is in fact "biased" against them. This will be strongly ahistorical to history *as we know it*.
- It requires arbitrary decisions on what folder level or which location a character is placed within- for instance, should an emperor be placed within their empire's higher folder, or within the lower capital folder?
## By Position

- Characters
	- Kings
	- Adventurers
	- Gods
	- Generals
	- Academics

This organization structure:

- Places a strong emphasis on a person's "position" within the world.
- Is helpful for finding characters, given sufficient breakdown by position.

However...

- This organization structure can suffer if several named people within a world/story share the same position.
- It ignores the very real idea that someone's position can drastically change in their lifetime.
- It is a categorical pigeonholing of characters into their positions in life.
- It is probably best paired in a hybrid manner with other forms of categorization as a result of these weaknesses.
