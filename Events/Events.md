# Events

Events within the world are contained here. Each event should have some basic details, including a name, a date, and pertinent information about the event.

## Creating a new event

A new event can be created by using the event template. There is no harm in picking the wrong template initially- it is easy to re-tag an article and edit it to your tastes.

### Timeline

The default Event template supports the Timeline feature. Near the top of every document is a hidden code block that allows you to specify the event's name, starting date, ending date, and other important details for the timeline plugin to function.

# Folder Organization

World builders are encouraged to create their own folders and organize appropriately.
